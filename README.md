# README

## Learning Goals
 * Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
 * Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms (form_tag or form_with), buttons, and links
 * Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
 * Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
 * Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
 * Write feature tests that fully cover the functionality of the application
 * Work with a legacy repo and add additional query and form functionality

## Setup

Ruby Version `2.7.4p191`
Rails Version `Rails 5.2.6`

#### Local Deployment

* Clone this repo
* In your CLI ::
   - Run `bundle install`
   - Run `rails db:{drop, create, migrate, seed}`
